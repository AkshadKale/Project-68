            <p>School life is one of the most important phases in the life of a man. It is the period during which one learns the basic principles of behavior, speech, and etiquette. School life, in fact, is a period of learning and training in all the aspects of the personality of a man. One gets training for maintaining physical fitness, increasing oneâ€™s mental powers, learning the proper code of behavior and understanding the basic concepts of life. School life is a period for the formation of character, mind, and body on sound lines.</p>

            <p>Another school activity which we did last year was tree plantation.We were really excited for that.First school buses took us to the spot where we have to plant trees.We had to plant bamboo trees.Our principal told us importance of planting trees,they told us by planting trees we can stop soil erosion.Each house were provided with a areato plant trees and two teachers.Our house planted nearly 1,200 bamboo plants.And all four houses together plant nearly 5,000 bamboo trees.</p>
